/* You will need to have two players with hands for playing War. That will look something like:
    player1 =
    player2 =
    and then values or randomized options from deck of cards (52 total, 4 suits).
    

This will need to include deck, with values (array) of:
    cardRank = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"];
    cardSuit = ["diamonds", "spades", "clubs", "hearts"]; 
    
    if cardRank is === for player1 and player2, no points to either player;
    return (cardRank + cardSuit) = gameDeck   

Will likely be using a "for" loop, while dealt # of cards from deck is available (i = 26, i--)
    console.log for both player1 and player2 for each turn;

    player#Score variable for total score (running total) - write/track as "return" until i = 0;

    Math.random() for which options are part of each player's 26 cards;
    array.pop() to remove the last item in randomized list of options for 26 cards?

    const cards = [cardFace]+[cardSuit];
        function dealCards() {
        cards.sort(function(){return 0.5 - Math.random()});
        }

StackOverflow Notes for randomizing deck cards:
    let rank = [ "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"];
    let suit = ["diamonds", "spades", "clubs", "hearts"];
    let deck= [];
    suits.forEach(function(suit){
        ranks.forEach(function(rank){
        deck.push(new Card(rank, suit));
     })
});

    function Card(rank, suit){
    this.card = rank;
    this.suit = suit;
    }

    function dealCard() {
      cards.sort(function(){return 0.5 - Math.random()});
    }

Displaying the winner:
    if player1 is > player2, then add +1 to player1Score;
    if player1 is < player2, then add +1 to player2Score;
    if player1 is === player2, then nothing happens (+0 or "else" statement for default);

Once i = 0, then display total points for each player (alert window) at end of game 
let winner;

 Once i = 0, "winner" = ?
    if (player1Score is > player2Score) {
        winner = "Player 1 wins!"} else if {
            player1Score is < player2Score;
        winner = "Player 2 wins!"} else {
            player1Score === player2Score;
        winner = "Both players tied!"};
         console.log(winner);

    alert(`Player 1 has scored ${player1Score}
    Player 2 has scored ${player2Score}
    ${winner}`)
        Possibly add: "Congrats " + winner + " for winning the game!"


Summary:
    Create a randomized deck of 52 cards, combining suits (Diamond, Spade, Heart, Club) and ranks (2, 3,...K, A)
            This is gameDeck array
                const gameDeck = []
                gameDeck.sort(function(Math.random));

    Then, use items listed in Deck array/object and divide between 2 players
            This is Player1 and Player 2 items/object
                player1Deck = gameDeck.slice(0, 25) or (0, half);
                player2Deck = gameDeck.slice(26, gameDeck.length) or (half);

            for (let i = 26; i >= playerDeck.length; i--) {
                console.log("Round " + i);
            }
    Next,
